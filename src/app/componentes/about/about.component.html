                                  <p class="wow fadeInUp">Living with passion is what I strictly adhere to. “Always do what you love” how much ever hackneyed this sounds it holds absolutely true. That's why I travel a lot. Not for the sole reason of “loving” to travel but it helps me to get rid of the world and escape into a different dimension of my own. As I am a travel freak I love freezing the moments I relish. The art of capturing photos is something I am always fascinated by.</p>

                                  <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">I am a continuous learner. Learning for me equates to exploring new ideas and growing as an individual. I just cannot imagine my life devoid of designing. I freely express my creativity and imagination by designing. And to give my passion of designing a platform I have a YouTube channel named, Codegrid.</p>
